// HINT:
// I've attached a program called JQuery to this document. You can read it's docs at 
// https://api.jquery.com/, though I wouldn't worry about getting too in depth with it just yet.

// You can access the text inside a textBox with this pattern: $("#`idOfInput`").val()
// You can also change the text in the box by adding a string (words between '') into .val()

// Using this pattern to access the text in the subscriber option, I would say: const subscriber =  $("#subsciber").val()
// To change subscirber i might say: $("#subscriber").val('Bill Baker')

// Another helpful link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String
// (notice that in the lines of data, the only empty spaces are to seperate columns, look into Array.prototype.split())





// Happy coding!
